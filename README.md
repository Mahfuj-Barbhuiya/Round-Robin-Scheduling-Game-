# Round Robin Scheduling Game

This repository contains a real-time Round Robin scheduler simulation (UI + visualization). The demo is included as `index.html` and can be opened locally in a browser.

Files
- `index.html` — Demo HTML (self-contained) showing the scheduler, Gantt chart, and controls.
- `RR.css` — Original file provided (contains the full HTML/CSS content as received).

Quick start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into the browser).
2. Adjust the number of processes, burst times, and time quantum in the control panel, then click "RUN SIMULATION".

Notes
- The original provided file was named `RR.css` but contained a full HTML document; I preserved the original file and added a working `index.html` for the demo.
- If you want the CSS split out into a separate stylesheet or want me to tidy filenames, I can update the repo in a follow-up commit.

Enjoy! If you'd like, I can add a short GIF or live demo page hosted via GitHub Pages next.
